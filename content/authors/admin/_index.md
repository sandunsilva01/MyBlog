Hello everyone !!! 

I'm a statistician specialized in biostatistics and data science. 

I’m currently working as a biostatistician at National Health Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Clinical Trial Center, University of Sydney. 

I have completed my bachelor’s degree in Statistics at University of Colombo, Sri Lanka. After a year of working as a data analyst/scientist in Sri Lanka, I was offered a full scholarship from Department of Health Science and Biostatistics at Swinburne University of Technology Australia to follow a Ph.D. in Statistics (STA90001) in the scope of Health Science (DR-HTHSCI), under the supervision of Prof. Denny Meyer and Dr. Madawa W. Jayawardana. 

My Ph.D. project was named as “Innovative Statistical Methods to Model and Evaluate Physical Activity Programs Engagement”, which comprises statistical and machine learning models to model mHealth physical activity programs. This Ph.D. project was done in collaboration with a US based world leading wellbeing program which is known as “Virgin Pulse Global Challenge”. The findings of the Ph.D. were well published in leading academic journals and international conferences.

During my Ph.D., I have consulted over 1000 students in advanced statistical modelling, time series analysis, machine learning, business forecasting and predictive analytics at three ranking universities namely Monash University, Melbourne University (MBS) and Swinburne University of Technology, with an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5. 

I have worked with Department of Transport, Victoria and Peter MacCallum Cancer Research Centre, Melbourne on various studies to solve real world problems. The findings of these studies have been published in leading academic journals. 

I enjoy myself working on real world health problems using data and statistics.
