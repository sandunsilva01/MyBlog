I’m S. Sandun Malpriya Silva who is a biostatistician currently working at National Health Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Clinical Trial Center, Faculty of Medicine and Health at University of Sydney. 

I have completed my bachelor’s degree in Statistics at University of Colombo, Sri Lanka in 2016.  Having maintained a Grade Point Average of 3.37 (84%) throughout the degree program, I was conferred a 2nd class upper division Hon. Degree, specialized in Statistics. After a year of working as a data analyst/scientist in Sri Lanka, I was offered a full scholarship from Department of Health Science and Biostatistics at Swinburne University of Technology Australia to follow a Ph.D. in Statistics (STA90001) in the scope of Health Science (DR-HTHSCI), under the supervision of Prof. Denny Meyer and Dr. Madawa W. Jayawardana. 

My Ph.D. project was named as “Innovative Statistical Methods to Model and Evaluate Physical Activity Programs Engagement”, which comprises statistical and machine learning models to evaluate and model mHealth physical activity programs. This Ph.D. project was done in collaboration with a US based world leading wellbeing program which is known as “Virgin Pulse Global Challenge”. The findings of the Ph.D. were well published in leading academic journals and international conferences.

During my Ph.D., I have consulted over 1000 students in advanced statistical modelling, time series analysis, machine learning, business forecasting and predictive analytics at three ranking universities namely Monash University, Melbourne University (MBS) and Swinburne University of Technology, with an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5.
