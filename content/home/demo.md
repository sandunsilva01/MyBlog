Hello world !!! 

Welcome to my personal blog where I love to share what I'm learning and researching through my PhD and also as a Biostatistician (at University of Sydney). 

I always love to improve the **world wide quality of living** through data. But you may wonder how? 
Simple answer is, **If we want to learn what's really happening around us, we have to learn statistics.** 

Here I will share my learning and the experience which I'm gathering along my journey. I really hope this will also help you in your data related endeavors. 

Well then this is my learning curve !!!


**Let's start digging.**
