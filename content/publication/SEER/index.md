abstract: Aside from cancer, death from non-accidental injury, including suicide, is the greatest cause of mortality for adolescent and young adults (AYA). A retrospective analysis of AYA (aged between 15 and 39) during 1975 to 2016 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was conducted. Training and test sets were used to develop a model predicting suicide in AYA with cancer. Model performance in predicting suicide was evaluated using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve.
