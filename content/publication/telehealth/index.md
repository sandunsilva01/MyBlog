abstract:  The delivery of videoconferencing psychotherapy (VCP) has been found to be an efficacious, acceptable and feasible treatment modality for individual therapy. However, less is known about the use of VCP for couple and family therapy (CFT). The focus of this systematic review was to examine the efficacy, feasibility and acceptability of using VCP as a treatment delivery modality for CFT. A systematic search was conducted, data relating to efficacy, feasibility and acceptability were extracted from included studies. The search returned 7,112 abstracts, with 37 papers included. The methods of the review were pre-registered. VCP for CFT was demonstrated to be feasible and acceptable. A meta analysis was not conducted; however, results from the included studies indicate that VCP is an efficacious delivery method for CFT. Recommendations for future research and implications regarding clinical practice are made, which may be of interest to practitioners given the COVID-19 pandemic.
