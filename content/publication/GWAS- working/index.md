abstract: Genome wide association analysis is a collection of methods which identifies association between different traits with genetic regions and features. This area of analysis is rapidly evolving in the medical research in order to promote personalise medicine and health care. In this study authors will be investigating an efficient method and an algorithm to filter out the importnant single single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 6 different outcome events out of 30 million SNPs.
